# C Compiler for YAPL

## What is YAPL?
YAPL stands for Yet Another Programming Language. It is a programming language I created. :-)

## Quick Start Guide
1. Add .exe extensions to cmp and src. cmp is the compiler, and src is the program generated from the object file that is in the repository (source.obj).
2. Open the MS-DOS command prompt. Type "cmp file.yapl" where file.yapl is the name of the YAPL source code file. (See source.yapl for an example of valid YAPL syntax.) file.obj will be outputted after running cmp.exe.
3. Use Link.exe that comes with the [MASM 6.15](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~pager/312/masm%20615.ZIP) assembler to create the executable file that is generated from the object file, which is generated by cmp.exe. Type "link file,,,util.lib" to link the file.obj object file with the util.lib library file.
4. Finally, type "file" to run your YAPL program.
5. Enjoy!
