# C Compiler for YAPL

## What is YAPL?
YAPL stands for Yet Another Programming Language. It is a programming language I created. :-)

## Quick Start Guide
Add .exe extensions to cmp and src. cmp is the compiler, and src is the program generated from the object file that is in the repository (source.obj).
