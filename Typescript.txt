Notes:
   -- Numbers are in bytes.
   -- Code sizes and fixup sizes stacks are used to create pairs of LEDATA and FIXUPP records.
   -- Sizes of code sizes and fixup sizes stacks must be the same.

Current size of code stack:        [ 9677]
Current size of fixup stack:       [  836]
Current size of code sizes stack:  [   48]
Current size of fixup sizes stack: [   48]

Maximum size of code stack:        [25000] <-- CODE_STACK_SIZE
Maximum size of fixup stack:       [10000] <-- FIXUP_STACK_SIZE
Maximum size of code sizes stack:  [  500] <-- SIZES_STACK_SIZE
Maximum size of fixup sizes stack: [  500] <-- SIZES_STACK_SIZE

Modify the four constants above to resize the respective stacks. The constants can be found in constants.h.

Hello World!

Enter a value for VAR1: 2

Enter a value for VAR2: 5

--- Begin WHILE loop ---

VAR1 is now equal to VAR2!

Enter a value for VAR3: 7

Decrementing VAR3...

The answer is 6

Decrementing VAR3...

The answer is 5

Decrementing VAR3...

The answer is 4

---  End WHILE loop  ---

VAR1 does not equal VAR2!

The answer is 6

The answer is 5

VAR1 is greater than VAR2!

--- Begin arithmetic calculations ---

Let VAR5 = 25.

VAR5 / -5

The answer is -5

-VAR5 / -5

The answer is 5

VAR5 * -5

The answer is -125

-VAR5 * -5

The answer is 125

VAR5 / -5 --> VAR5

The answer is -5

-VAR5 * -5 --> VAR5

The answer is 125

*************************************

Let VAR3 = 20 and VAR4 = 40.

VAR3 + -VAR4

The answer is -20

VAR3 - -VAR4

The answer is 60

-VAR3 + -VAR4

The answer is -60

-VAR3 - -VAR4

The answer is 20

VAR3 - -VAR4 --> VAR3

The answer is 60

-VAR3 + -VAR4 --> VAR3

The answer is -60

*************************************

Let VAR1 = 5, VAR2 = 10, VAR3 = 15, and VAR4 = 20.

VAR1 + VAR2 - VAR3 - VAR4 --> VAR5

The answer is -20

VAR2 * 5 * 5 + VAR3 + VAR3 - -VAR4 --> VAR5

The answer is 300

VAR4 / 5 * -VAR1 * -5 / -VAR4 --> VAR5

The answer is -5

Negating VAR5...

The answer is 5

-VAR5 + 5 --> VAR5

The answer is -15

-VAR5 - 5 * -1 - 5 + 10 --> VAR5

The answer is 30

*************************************

Let VAR1 = 1.

VAR1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 * -6 / 3 * 10 / -2

The answer is -10

VAR1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 * 3 / -3 * -4 / 2 --> VAR2

The answer is 6

---  End arithmetic calculations  ---

--- Begin DO loop ---

Let VAR1 = 2 and VAR4 = 2.

The answer is 2
